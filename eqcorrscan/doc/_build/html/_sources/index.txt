EQcorrscan
----------

A python package to conduct match-filter earthquake detections.  Codes are stored
on github, the master and development branches are |github_link|, or the latest stable(ish) release
can be found |releases_link|

This package contains routines to enable the user to conduct match-filter earthquake
detections using |Obspy_link| bindings when reading
and writing seismic data, and the correlation routine in |opencv_link|.
Neither of these packages are installed by this software, due to a range of
licenses being implemented.  However, both are open-source and should be installed
before using this package.  This package was written to implement the matlab routines
used by Chamberlain et al. (2014) for the detection of low-frequency earthquakes.

Also within this package are:

* Clustering routines for seismic data;
* Peak finding algorithm (basic);
* Automatic amplitude picker for local magnitude scale;
* |seisan_link| S-file integration for database management and routine earthquake location;
* Stacking routines including phase-weighted stacking based on Thurber at al. (2014);
* Brightness based template creation based on the work of Frank et al. (2014)
