EQcorrscan
==========

A Python package for the detection and analysis of repeating and near-repeating seismicity.
EQcorrscan contains an efficient, multi-parallel,
:doc:`matched-filter </submodules/core.match_filter>` detection routine, as well as
routines to implement :doc:`subspace </submodules/core.subspace>` detection,
and detection based on :doc:`brightness </submodules/core.bright_lights>`.

Code is stored on github, the development branches are |github_link|, or the latest stable release
can be found |releases_link|.

EQcorrscan uses |Obspy_link| bindings when reading and writing seismic data, and for handling most
of the event metadata, which ensures that detections can be easily migrated between
softwares. Matched-filter correlations are calculated using |opencv_link|.
OpenCV is not installed alongside EQcorrscan and must be installed
before using this package.

* :doc:`Automatic amplitude picker for local magnitude scale </submodules/utils.mag_calc>`;
* |seisan_link| :doc:`S-file integration </submodules/utils.sfile_util>` for database management and routine earthquake location;
* :doc:`Stacking routines </submodules/utils.stacking>` including phase-weighted stacking based on Thurber at al. (2014);
* :doc:`Brightness based template creation </submodules/core.bright_lights>` based on the work of Frank et al. (2014)
