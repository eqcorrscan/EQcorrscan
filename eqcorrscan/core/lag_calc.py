"""
Functions to generate lag-times for events detected by correlation.

Part of the EQcorrscan module to integrate seisan nordic files into a full
cross-channel correlation for detection routine.
EQcorrscan is a python module designed to run match filter routines for
seismology, within it are routines for integration to seisan and obspy.
With obspy integration (which is necessary) all main waveform formats can be
read in and output.

This main section contains a script, LFE_search.py which demonstrates the usage
of the built in functions from template generation from picked waveforms
through detection by match filter of continuous data to the generation of lag
times to be used for relative locations.

The match-filter routine described here was used a previous Matlab code for the
Chamberlain et al. 2014 G-cubed publication.  The basis for the lag-time
generation section is outlined in Hardebeck & Shelly 2011, GRL.

Code generated by Calum John Chamberlain of Victoria University of Wellington,
2015.

    - gcc             - for the installation of the openCV correlation routine
    - python-cv2      - Python bindings for the openCV routines
    - python-joblib   - used for parallel processing
    - python-obspy    - used for lots of common seismological processing
