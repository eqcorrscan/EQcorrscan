"""
Python QT GUI for selection of template events.  In early stages of \
development, but the plan is to have a catalogue plot window with button \
options including:\
- cluster
- stack
- plot waveforms
- generate templates
It should also have a list of events which can be selected from for all of \
those actions and highlighted in the catalogue plot window.  This will end up \
being a dog to write I think.  Any help would be appreciated!
