# Installation
Installation has been tested on both OSX and Linux (Ubuntu), and now
Windows systems.  We support Python versions 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.

Note that, although we support Windows, EQcorrscan is optimized for
linux style distributions, it will work on Windows, but everything
seems to run about 30x slower at the moment.

Installation for all systems should be as simple as:

```bash
pip install EQcorrscan
```

If upgrading from a previous version, rather than running install --upgrade, I recommend the following:

```bash
pip install -U --no-deps EQcorrscan
```

This will not try to upgrade your dependencies, which is not needed.  You should
to update your obspy version to 1.0.x which was recently released.  We have tested
this and support it, nevertheless, if you find any issues then let us know.

*You will likely need sudo/root permissions to run this command.*

If you have any issues installing please report them on the issues pages.

You will need to install openCV (note that openCV versions 2 and 3 work for
Python 2.7, but only openCV version 3 works for Python 3.x, therefore we
recommend installing openCV 3). We recommend installing openCV from source,
this will both optimize it for your machine, and ensure you don't break your python
by using conda.

If you are running Linux or OSX, installation
instructions can be found
[here for ubuntu](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/07/20/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-3-4-on-ubuntu/)
and [here for OSX](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/15/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-2-7-on-osx/).
Note these two links are Python dependent and you will need to change your pip
and python versions appropriate to your system.  Similar instructions are
available for Windows users.

*A note for Ubuntu users*
You will need the python3.x-dev libraries to install openCV if installing from
source.

*A note on correlation precision*
OpenCV computes cross-correlations in the frequency-domain for normal seismic
datasets (if the dataset is very small then the cross-correlation will be
computed in the time-domain, but this is rare for seismic data).  In testing we
have found that different methods of installing openCV provide different results
for cross-correlations at the very low-end of cross-correlations.  We think this
comes down to how the ffts are computed.  However, for moderate to high cross-correlations
(above 0.05 normalised cross-correlation), all methods provide the same result.

The outcome of this is that for very low thresholds, you may see changes in
your results, however for standard operations this is not an issue.  We have found
that differences are, on average, 0.0024 - which shifts the mean of a single
channel cross-correlation from very close to zero, to 0.0024, and alters the
median.  However we have found that this results in no change in the median
absolute deviation of the data, so thresholds based on this will be the same,
although the cross-correlations themselves will be shifted.  You would have to be
running a very low threshold to see the result of this (0.5 * MAD, rather than
commonly used values around 8 * MAD).

# Documentation

The full documentation for this package can be found here:
[Docs](http://eqcorrscan.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest).
Any errors including typos and just missing bits can either be fixed by you,
or flagged in the issues tab here.  We host our docs on readthedocs, which
uses sphinx to scrape the docstrings in the codes, so it is simple to
match the docs to the codes and change the docstrings.

We also have a github-pages site [EQcorrscan](http://calum-chamberlain.github.io/EQcorrscan/),
which uses jekyll to build the site.  Changes or additions to this site can be made on
the gh-pages branch.

# Functionality

This package contains routines to enable the user to conduct match-filter earthquake
detections using [obspy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki) bindings when reading
and writing seismic data, and the correlation routine in [openCV](http://opencv.org/).
The OpendCV package is not installed by this software, due to a need to build from
source.  The user should follow the instructions above for OpenCV install.
This package was written to implement the Matlab routines
used by Chamberlain et al. (2014) for the detection of low-frequency earthquakes.

Also within this package are:
* Clustering routines for seismic data;
* Peak finding algorithm (basic, but appropriate for noisy data);
* Automatic amplitude picker for local magnitude scale;
* [Seisan](http://seisan.info/) S-file integration for database management and routine earthquake location;
* Obspy.core.event integration, which opens up lots of other functions (Seishub, hypoDDpy etc.);
* Stacking routines including phase-weighted stacking based on Thurber at al. (2014);
* Brightness based template creation based on the work of Frank et al. (2014);
* Singular Value Decomposition derived magnitude calculations based on Rubinstein & Ellsworth (2010).

We are currently hovering around 9,000 lines of code (including doc-strings) - it is probably worth
having a look at the docs to check what functions we have.  We plan to write a series of tutorials to be
included on the EQcorrscan API to highlight key functions, currently our tutorials only show
how to do the core matched-filter detection.

# Contributing

Please fork this project and work on it there then create a pull request to
merge back to this main repository.  If you are working on a bug-fix then
use the *develop* branch, otherwise, create a feature branch and work
on your addition there.

When you make changes please run the tests in the test directory to ensure
everything merges with minimum effort.  If there is not yet a test to cope
with your changes then please write one.

Please document your functions following the other documentation within the
functions, these doc-scripts will then be built into the main documentation
using Sphinx.

We are trying to implement a better branching model, following that found [here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
To this end, please fork the development branch if you want to develop
things, and flag issues in the master for us to bugfix.
If you have a feature you want to develop please create a new branch
from the development branch and work on it there, we can then merge
it back in to the development branch when it is stable enough.

This branching model (git-flow) is pretty well established, and I would recommend
you to install [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Installation) and
read their [documentation](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow). It seems pretty intuitive and
will keep us all branching in the same way.
